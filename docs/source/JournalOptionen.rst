Journal Options
=====

**Priority**:

Allows the assignment of low, normal, or high priority. This can be displayed in the journal list or used in advanced filtering.

**Confidentiality**:
You can set a confidentiality level for your emails/journals to let recipients know about your intentions when sending a message. The following options are available:

- normal: Corresponds to no specific confidentiality level and, therefore, does not display any indication in the journal's status bar. Visibility is set to "All employees."

- private: The journal's status bar displays the text "Please consider this matter as private!" Visibility is set to the logged-in user.

- personal: The journal's status bar displays the text "Please consider this matter as personal!" Visibility is set to the logged-in user.

- confidential: The journal's status bar displays the text "Please consider this matter as confidential!" Visibility is set to the logged-in user and all employees linked to the journal.

When Sending an Email: The confidentiality level is transferred to the email and sent to the email recipient.
When Importing an Email: The confidentiality level is taken from the email and applied to the journal, setting the visibility accordingly.
